# Image Captioning Model - BLIP

## Introduction
 Image Captioning Model - BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training). This model is designed for unified vision-language understanding and generation tasks. It is trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset using a base architecture with a ViT (Vision Transformer) large backbone.

The image captioning model is implemented using the PyTorch framework and leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library for efficient natural language processing.


## Example Images with Generated Captions
Here are some example images along with the captions generated by the BLIP image captioning model:

![Image 1](images/football.jpeg)

Generated Caption: "Group of young children playing soccer on a field."

![Image 2](images/jeep-woods.jpg)

Generated Caption: "Jeep driving down a dirt road in the woods."

![Image 3](images/sunset.jpeg)

Generated Caption: "A beautiful sunset over the ocean with waves crashing on the shore."

## Pre-trained Weights
Caption can be generate for any image at [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/luv-bansal/demo-app)

## Requirements
To run the image captioning model, the following dependencies are required:
- Python (version 3.7 or above)
- PyTorch (version 1.8 or above)
- Transformers library (version 4.3 or above)

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
